## Bank-Loan-Analysis

### Project Overview:

This project delivers a comprehensive analysis of bank loan data, focusing on distinguishing between good and bad loans, and providing actionable insights into customer behavior, loan purposes, and repayment performance. Through SQL-driven data extraction and cleansing, we segment customers based on key demographics, credit scores, and income levels. We categorize loans by purpose and assess their direct impact on default rates. 

The outcome includes interactive Power BI dashboards and reports that effectively visualize essential metrics such as approval rates, average loan amounts, and repayment timelines. These insights will drive improvements in loan processes, reduce default rates, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.

### Project Goals:

1. **Total Loan Applications:** Total number of loan applications received within a **correct - specified period**. Track Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes to monitor trends.
2. **Loan Purpose Breakdown:** Distribution of loan applications based on the stated purposes (e.g., personal, home, business), aiding in the understanding of borrowers' primary reasons for seeking loans.
3. **Employee Length Analysis:** Assess how loan applications are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths, helping evaluate the impact of employment history on loan approvals.
4. **Total Funded Amount:** Total funds disbursed across all loan applications. Monitor the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyze MoM variations to understand lending activity over time.
5. **Total Amount Received:** Monitor the total amount received from borrowers for loan repayments. Analyze MTD and MoM changes to assess cash flow and repayment trends.
6. **Average Interest Rate:** Average interest rate across all loans. Track MTD interest rates and MoM changes to analyze the overall cost of lending.
7. **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** Average DTI of borrowers to assess their financial health and ability to repay loans. Track MTD and MoM fluctuations to monitor the borrowers' economic capacity.

8. **Home Ownership Analysis:** Home ownership impact on loan applications and disbursements for a hierarchical view of borrower status.
